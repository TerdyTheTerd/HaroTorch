  ## HaroTorch Language File Collection
  
  In this folder you can find available language files provided by me and the community.
  
  If you notice any mistakes in these files, please do not hesitate to let me know by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/TheDutchMC/HaroTorch/issues) with the changes  
  that should be made. Or alternatively, if you know how to work with Git, you can open a Pull Request.
  
  If you have your own translated version and want the community to be able to use your translations, you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/TheDutchMC/HaroTorch/issues)  
  and include the translation. You can also E-mail it to github@thedutchmc.nl, make sure you include your GitHub profile, or your SpigotMC profile so I can credit you appropriately.  
  If you know how to work with Git, you may also open a Pull Request.
